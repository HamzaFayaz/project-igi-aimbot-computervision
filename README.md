> ## **💡 Special Note**:
This project uses a fully custom dataset that I built entirely from scratch. Every single image was individually collected, annotated, and preprocessed by hand — no pre-made datasets were used. By curating the dataset image by image, I ensured maximum relevance, precision, and quality, which leads to superior model performance compared to relying on generic datasets.
